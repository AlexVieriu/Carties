2. Course pre-requisites

Source code:
https://github.com/trycatchlearn/carsties 
-> in the repo we have the steps for running the apps


3. Setting up the developer environment

https://code.visualstudio.com/
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
https://nodejs.org/en/download/current
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet
https://www.postman.com/downloads/
https://git-scm.com/downloads 


4. Course assets and source code  

-> copy the repo to the local 

Open Visual Sudio Code:
CTL + ~ (to open the terminal)
cd "D:\Programare\Proiecte\Micro with NextJS\Udemy Project" (where i want the project to be)
git clone https://github.com/TryCatchLearn/Carsties.git
cd Carsties
git log
git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph 	(press Q to exit the logs in terminal)
git checkout 5b3f518				(getting to the branch 5b3f518)		
git checkout main				(getting to the branch main)
git config --global alias.adog "log --all --decorate --oneline --graph" (get an alias for the command)

5. VSC troubleshooting and tips

-- Extensions --
powershell -> ii "D:\Programare\Proiecte\Micro with NextJS\CourseAssets\specs\vscode.pdf" (open specific folder)
C# extensions -> create class 

-- Problems --
-> if we don't see the definition of the class -> ctrl+shift+p -> Developer: Reload Windows
-> output -> change from the write dropdown list: C#, C# dev kit, .Net Runtime


6. Microservices - the big picture

Advantages
-> loosely coupled services
-> for large scale app
-> for large teams
-> each microservice is responsible for own data
-> use gRPC for intern communication
-> if we lost service A, service B can still be called  
-> we can deploy the service often, independent from other services

Disadvantages
-> has multiple DBs that need to be managed
-> the cost is high
